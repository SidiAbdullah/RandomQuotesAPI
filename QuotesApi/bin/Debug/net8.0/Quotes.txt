Stay hungry, stay foolish.
Success is not final; failure is not fatal.
What you do today can improve all your tomorrows.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
Dream big. Start small. Act now.
Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
Act as if what you do makes a difference. It does.
The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.
You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions.
